## Introduction

**ProgrammedFanTweaker** Server Thermal Manager is a modern Windows desktop application designed to solve the problem of excessive fan noise from servers, especially in home or office environments. By leveraging the IPMI protocol, this tool allows users to bypass the server's default, often aggressive, fan control policies and implement custom manual or automatic fan speed adjustments. Its intuitive WinUI 3 interface not only displays real-time critical CPU temperature data but also shows historical temperature changes in a chart, helping you easily find the sweet spot between server performance and quiet operation.

## Core Features

*   üå¨Ô∏è **IPMI Fan Control:** Directly override and control server fan speeds using IPMI commands.
*   üå°Ô∏è **CPU Temperature Monitoring:** Display real-time CPU core temperatures and analyze temperature trends with a historical line chart.
*   ü§ñ **Automatic & Manual Modes:**
    *   **Automatic Mode:** Automatically adjusts fan speeds based on temperature thresholds you set.
    *   **Manual Mode:** Locks the fans to run at a specified speed.
*   üö® **Safety Protection Mechanism:** When CPU temperature reaches a critical threshold, the fans are automatically ramped up to high speed to ensure hardware safety.
*   üñ•Ô∏è **Visual Server Layout:** Provides a graphical layout of the server's internal components, intuitively displaying temperature and fan status for each zone.
*   üé® **Personalized Themes:** Supports System, Light, and Dark theme modes for a comfortable visual experience.
*   üåê **Multi-language Support (i18n):** Built-in support for English and Simplified Chinese for users of different languages.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **System Tray Integration:** Can be minimized to the system tray to run quietly in the background without disturbing your work.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

1.  **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later.
2.  **.NET Runtime:** [.NET 8 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).
3.  **Server:** A server that supports IPMI. (Currently only Dell PowerEdge R730/R730 XD is supported).
4.  **IPMI Configuration:** Ensure "IPMI over LAN" is enabled in your server's iDRAC.
5.  **(Optional) Core Temp:** If you need to obtain CPU temperature via Core Temp, ensure it is running.

Note: The current version only supports and has been tested on Dell PowerEdge R730/R730 XD. Support for other servers will be added in future versions.
Note: The current version only supports reading processor temperature via Core Temp. Other methods for obtaining processor temperature will be added in future versions.

### Installation Steps

#### Method 1: Download from Releases (Recommended)

1.  Go to the project's [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/CoWave-Fall/IPMI-ProgrammedFanTweaker/releases).
2.  Download the latest release version (usually a `.zip` or `.msix` installer).
3.  Unzip or run the installer to complete the installation.

#### Method 2: Build from Source

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CoWave-Fall/IPMI-ProgrammedFanTweaker.git
    cd ProgrammedFanTweaker
    ```2.  **Build the project:**
    Open the solution (`.sln`) file with Visual Studio 2022 and build, or use the following command:
    ```bash
    dotnet build -c Release
    ```

### Configuration Requirements

1.  **iDRAC Settings:** Log in to iDRAC, navigate to `iDRAC Settings` -> `Network` -> `Services`, and ensure the `IPMI Over LAN` option is enabled.
2.  **In-app Configuration:** Enter your iDRAC IP address, username, and password in the application.
